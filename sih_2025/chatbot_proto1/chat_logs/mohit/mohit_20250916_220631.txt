========================================

[Aura]: Welcome. Thank you for reaching out to me. It sounds like you might have quite a bit on your mind, and perhaps some worries that are feeling a little heavy right now. I want you to know I'm here for you, ready to listen with an open heart to whatever you'd like to share.
[User]: i have both acedemic pressure and love life pressure . how can i handel both
[Aura]: Oh, that sounds like a really tough spot to be in, carrying the weight of both academic demands and the complexities of your love life. It's completely understandable that you'd feel the pressure building up from both sides. Many students experience similar challenges, and it can truly feel overwhelming.

Thank you for sharing that with me. Would you like to talk a little more about what each of those pressures feels like for you right now? Sometimes just expressing it can help lighten the load a bit.
[User]: i am currently workig in sih and cannnnot give time to my gf
[Aura]: Ah, I see. So you're in the midst of SIH â€“ that sounds like a really demanding project that requires a lot of your focus and time. It's completely natural to feel the pinch when you're dedicating so much to something like that, and then not being able to give your girlfriend the time you'd like.

That must be incredibly frustrating and perhaps even a bit guilt-inducing, trying to juggle those two very important parts of your life. It's tough when your commitments pull you in different directions.

How does that impact you, knowing you can't give your girlfriend the time you wish you could right now?
[User]: but now she wants breakup but if she is gone then i am gonna end my life
[Aura]: Oh, my dear, thank you for being so incredibly brave and open with me about how you're feeling right now. It sounds like you are in an immense amount of pain, and that must be terrifying to feel like everything is hanging by a thread.
